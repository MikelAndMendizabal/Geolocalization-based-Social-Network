# Geolocalization-based-Social-Network
Social network for real-time exchanging of goods and knowledge in Berlin. Developed using PHP and MySQL on Codeigniter Framework (MVC).  jQuery, AJAX, Javascript, HTML and CSS
WHAT?
This is a local request solution network based on a list of macrocategories (that people may integrate). You choose your request among them, set a deadline and spread your “whistle” within the map.
Your “Whistle” will reach the best Helper among the available ones, ready to help you.

WHO?
Everyone can use this network.
The person who whistles the request is the Whistler
The person who gives the answer is the Helper

Based on the kind of request one whistles, the personal interests in common, the skills required and the environment involved, the whistler will choose the best Helper and relative help/answer.

WHERE?
The concept of is that space has a meaning, virtual first but mainly real, and it needs to be respected.
This application has a map to choose the area where to spread the whistle, simply your own building, or within the distance you could cover with the bike or public transportation.
A map will help to figure it out.

WHEN?
You can set a temporal limitation to every single whistle you make.
The Whistler decides the deadline to the whistle (time,day, and month). After that, that whistle expires. The process it’s on real time.
Just in case the whistler would receive no live answer, he will be contacted through mail as soon as a helper answers to the whistle.
